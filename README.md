# How to Run

Assuming you have *node* and *npm* properly installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repo
2. In your terminal navigate to the project folder where `package.json` is located
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
4. Run `npm install -g nodemon` to install the project dependencies
4. Run `nodemon app.js` to monitor your project for changes (code/visual changes without server restart) and see the changes by **refreshing your browser window**
5. Run `npm start` to get the app running on `localhost:3000`

>"**nodemon**. For use during development of a node.js based application. nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application. nodemon does not require any changes to your code or method of development."
